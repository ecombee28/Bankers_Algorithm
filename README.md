# Bankers_Algorithm
This Program show a visual example of the Bankers algorithm. Bankers algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra.This algorithm tests for saftey by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximun possible amounts of resources. 
# How to Run
I have included three text files that you can use to test the algorithm. Each one are labeled according to what they intill.
